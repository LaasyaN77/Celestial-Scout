# Celestial-Scout-Project
1. Developed a modular software application using MATLAB that identifies and visualizes visible constellations based on the user’s location, date, and time with a seamless user interface.
2. Utilized a star database and mathematical calculations for real-time constellation mapping.
3. Designed interactive 3D plots for multi-angle constellation visualization, integrated altitude and azimuth calculations for precise stargazing, and incorporated mythological insights for an educational experience.
